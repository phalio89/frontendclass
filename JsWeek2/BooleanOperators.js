// += The addition assignment operator (+=) adds the value of the right operand to a variable and assigns the result to the variable. The types of the two operands determine the behavior of the addition assignment operator. Addition or concatenation is possible.
// let a = 2 console.log(a += 3); answer is 5

/* +	Adds two numeric operands.
-	Subtract right operand from left operand
*	Multiply two numeric operands.
/	Divide left operand by right operand.
%	Modulus operator. Returns remainder of two operands.
++	Increment operator. Increase operand value by one.
--	Decrement operator. Decrease value by one.*/

5 == 4  //5 is equal to 4 false
5 > 4   // 5 is greater than 4 true
4 < 10  // 4 is less than 10 true
10 >= 10 // 10 is greater than or equal to 10 true
11 <= 8  // 11 is less than or equal to 8 false

5 > 4 && 4 > 10  // 5 is greater than 4 and 4 is less than 10
4 > 10 || 1 == 1 // 4 is greater to 10 is false but 1 == 1 is true so it is true
